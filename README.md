this is an restaurant website created for marketing an restaurant as a personal project

overview: 
I developed a restaurant website as a personal project to showcase my web development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website features a modern and responsive design, providing users with a seamless browsing experience across devices. Key highlights include a visually appealing homepage, a detailed about section narrating the restaurant's story, an interactive menu displaying dishes with descriptions and images, and a gallery showcasing the ambiance and cuisine. Additionally, the site includes a reservation form with basic JavaScript validation and an integrated Google Maps location. With smooth animations, intuitive navigation, and a focus on user experience, this project reflects my ability to create functional and visually engaging websites tailored to business needs.
